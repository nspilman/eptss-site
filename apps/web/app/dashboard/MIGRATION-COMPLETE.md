# Dashboard Migration Complete ✅

## What Changed

The main dashboard (`/dashboard/page.tsx`) has been migrated from the old component-based approach to the new modular `@eptss/dashboard` package system.

## Architecture

### Separation of Concerns

The new architecture maintains proper separation:

1. **Dashboard Package** (`packages/dashboard/`)
   - Provides reusable panel components (HeroPanel, ActionPanel, CurrentRoundPanel, ReflectionPanel)
   - Handles layout, priority-based rendering, and collapsible panels
   - **Does NOT** depend on `@eptss/data-access` (stays decoupled)

2. **Web App** (`apps/web/app/dashboard/`)
   - Fetches data using `@eptss/data-access`
   - Transforms data into panel-specific formats
   - Passes data to dashboard via `panelData` prop

### Key Files

#### `data-fetchers.ts` (NEW)
Contains all data fetching logic for dashboard panels:
- `fetchHeroData()` - Round number and song info
- `fetchActionData()` - Primary CTA with urgency levels
- `fetchCurrentRoundData()` - User progress and status
- `fetchReflectionData()` - User reflections

This file is in the **web app**, not the dashboard package, because:
- It depends on `@eptss/data-access`
- It contains business logic specific to EPTSS
- It keeps the dashboard package reusable

#### `page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- Fetches all panel data in parallel
- Passes data to `<Dashboard>` component
- Keeps `URLParamsHandler` and `VerificationAlert` from old system

#### `dashboard-config.ts` (EXISTING)
Defines which panels to show and in what order:
1. HeroPanel (order: 1)
2. ActionPanel (order: 2) - **NEW!** Prominent CTA
3. CurrentRoundPanel (order: 3) - Status only
4. ReflectionPanel (tertiary, collapsible)

## New Features

### ActionPanel
The biggest improvement! Separates "what to do next" from "current status":

- **Urgency Levels**: `normal`, `warning`, `urgent` (color-coded)
- **Time Remaining**: Shows deadline countdown
- **Context Messages**: Explains what the action is for
- **High Priority**: Positioned right after hero for visibility

### Benefits Over Old System

**Before:**
```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<HeroSkeleton />}>
  <DashboardHero />
</Suspense>
<Suspense fallback={<CurrentRoundSkeleton />}>
  <CurrentRoundCard />
</Suspense>
// ... manual Suspense for each component
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Dashboard
  config={eptssDeboardConfig}
  user={user}
  panelData={{ hero, action, currentRound, reflections }}
/>
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Configuration-based (add panels by updating config)
- ✅ Automatic Suspense handling
- ✅ Priority-based grid layout
- ✅ Collapsible panels
- ✅ Role-based visibility
- ✅ Prominent CTAs with ActionPanel

## Old Files Preserved

The old components are still in `components/` directory:
- `DashboardHero/`
- `CurrentRoundCard/`
- `NextRoundCard/`
- `ReflectionCard/`

These can be removed once we're confident the new system works in production.

## Testing

1. **Test Page**: Visit `/dashboard/test-new-dashboard` to see mock data
2. **Main Dashboard**: Visit `/dashboard` to see real data
3. **Different States**: Test all phases (signups, covering, voting, celebration)

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the old page is preserved as `page.tsx.old` (if you created it).

To rollback:
1. Restore old `page.tsx` from git history
2. The old components are still in `components/` directory
3. No changes were made to `@eptss/data-access`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Monitor dashboard in production
2. ⏳ Remove old component files once confident
3. ⏳ Add more panels (Community, Streak, etc.) by updating config
4. ⏳ Consider adding NextRound panel to new system

## Why This Architecture?

**Q: Why doesn't the dashboard package fetch its own data?**

A: Separation of concerns. The dashboard package is a **reusable UI component library**. It shouldn't know about EPTSS-specific data fetching logic. This keeps it:
- Decoupled from business logic
- Potentially reusable in other projects
- Easier to test (just pass mock data)

The web app handles data fetching because:
- It already depends on `@eptss/data-access`
- It knows the business logic (urgency calculations, phase transitions)
- It can optimize data fetching (parallel requests, caching)

This is similar to how UI libraries like shadcn/ui work - they provide components, you provide the data.
