# Dashboard Cleanup Summary

## Files Deleted

### Old Component Directory
**Deleted**: `apps/web/app/dashboard/components/`

This directory contained the old component-based dashboard implementation:
- `DashboardHero/` - Replaced by `HeroPanel` in `@eptss/dashboard`
- `CurrentRoundCard/` - Replaced by `CurrentRoundPanel` and `ActionPanel`
- `NextRoundCard/` - Not yet migrated (can be added later as a panel)
- `ReflectionCard/` - Replaced by `ReflectionPanel`
- `TimeRemainingDisplay/` - Replaced by `PhaseStatusPanel`
- `URLParamsHandler/` - Still used (not deleted)
- `VerificationAlert/` - Still used (not deleted)

### Old Actions File
**Deleted**: `apps/web/app/dashboard/actions.ts`

This file contained server actions that were specific to the old dashboard implementation.

### Test Directory
**Deleted**: `apps/web/app/dashboard/test-new-dashboard/`

This was a test page for the new dashboard system. Now that the main dashboard uses the new system, this test page is no longer needed.

## Files Kept

### Core Dashboard Files
- ✅ `page.tsx` - Main dashboard page (now uses modular system)
- ✅ `dashboard-config.ts` - Panel configuration
- ✅ `data-fetchers.ts` - Data fetching logic

### Documentation
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE-FIX.md` - Server/client component fix
- ✅ `MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md` - Migration documentation
- ✅ `NEW-DASHBOARD-README.md` - Original dashboard readme
- ✅ `PHASE-FLOW-FIX.md` - Phase order correction
- ✅ `PHASE-STATUS-PANEL.md` - Phase status panel docs

## What Replaced What

| Old Component | New Panel | Location |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| `DashboardHero` | `HeroPanel` | `@eptss/dashboard/panels` |
| `CurrentRoundCard` | `CurrentRoundPanel` + `ActionPanel` | `@eptss/dashboard/panels` |
| `TimeRemainingDisplay` | `PhaseStatusPanel` | `@eptss/dashboard/panels` |
| `ReflectionCard` | `ReflectionPanel` | `@eptss/dashboard/panels` |
| `NextRoundCard` | Not yet migrated | Future enhancement |

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Old components are gone, only new modular system remains
2. **Clearer Structure**: Dashboard directory is much simpler
3. **Single Source of Truth**: All dashboard panels are in `@eptss/dashboard` package
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Configuration-based system is easier to modify

## Future Enhancements

Components not yet migrated:
- `NextRoundCard` - Can be added as a panel when needed
- `URLParamsHandler` - Could be integrated into dashboard system
- `VerificationAlert` - Could be integrated into dashboard system

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to the old system:
1. The old components are in git history
2. Restore from commit before cleanup
3. Revert `page.tsx` to use old component imports

However, the new modular system is recommended for all future development.

## Migration Complete! ✅

The dashboard has been successfully migrated to the modular `@eptss/dashboard` package system, and all old redundant code has been removed.
