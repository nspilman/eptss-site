There are a great number of new folks this round, and I wanted to put together a quick write up on how to schedule your cover work over the next ten weeks (give or take).

**Updated on 2025-04-26 to accommodate for longer cover windows.** Not every cover phase is exactly 10 weeks—sometimes it's a little shorter, sometimes a little longer—but the examples below should be relevant no matter the exact timeline.

Sometimes, the song is selected and you'll know exactly what you want to do. Often times, though, the covering road forward is unclear. I find that even when I have a creative aim in mind, I still miss and land somewhere else. It's all part of the journey.

Below are a few strategies for how to chunk up your work over a ten week cover period.

### Slow and Steady

One way to tackle a longer window is to start early! Many folks with varying degrees of executive disfunction - me included - struggle with getting started when the deadline is so far away. That said, starting as early as you can can provide you opportunity to slowly iterate through ideas. Sometimes it can take a while before you've identified the direction you want to head, so giving yourself time to aimlessly wander, without time pressure, can be a huge help and a lot of fun. As the project has progressed, I try to take this strategy more and more.

- _weeks 1–4_ – Spend a few hours each week playing around with ideas and following leads you enjoy.
- _weeks 5–8_ – By now, you might still be in the ideating phase or you may have a clear vision of what you want to do. You may be ready to close your cover out, or really just get started with the bulk of it.
- _weeks 9–10_ – At this point, you should be casually wrapping things up, obsessively listening to your work with pride and scrutiny.

### Back-loaded

In this strategy, don't touch your instrument, DAW, microphone, etc for the first several weeks. Listen to the song a million and a half times to get to a point where you've identified the elements you want to include in your cover, and spend leisure time thinking about the direction you want to take your version. Then, in the last few weeks, go HAM. I think most of my covers have come out of this strategy.

- _weeks 1–6_ – Do a lot of song listening, analysis and planning.
- _weeks 7–8_ – Jump in! By this point you should have a general idea of the direction you want to take.
- _weeks 9–10_ – There's a good chance you still have a ton of work to do. Especially if you're newer to music production, or whatever skill you're practicing, don't be surprised if you spend most of your free time these last couple weeks on closing your song out.

### Procrastination

In this strategy, do nothing until week ten. Once week ten hits, start screaming, and use the time pressure to make diamonds.

- _weeks 1–9_ – Do a lot of song listening, analysis and planning. Or, you know, procrastinate.
- _week 10_ – AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH. Spend all of your free time working on your cover.

### The one-take recording

In this strategy, you're not doing any fancy production work. Spend as much time as you'd like practicing the song, and when you're ready, record a one-take cover! Add harmony vocals if you'd like, but you do you!

- _weeks 1–6_ – Do a lot of song listening, analysis and planning.
- _weeks 7–9_ – Play the song a bunch on your instrument of choice to really get to know it.
- _week 10_ – Record a baller one-take and call it a round!

### Conclusion

Whatever your strategy, have fun with it, and trust your taste! Whether your cover window is exactly 10 weeks or not, these approaches should help you get the most out of the process. Thank you for participating, and I can't wait to hear what you put together!
