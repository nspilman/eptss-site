title: Winning Strategies for Scheduling your Cover work
subtitle: A few frameworks to consider when planning your cover work
---

There are a great number of new folks this round, and I wanted to put together a quick write up on how to scheduling your cover work over the next month.
Sometimes, the song is selected and you'll know exactly what you want to do. Often times, though, the covering road forward is unclear. I find that even when I have a creative aim in mind, I still miss and land somewhere else. It's all part of the journey.

Below are a few strategies for how to chunk up your work over the four week cover period.

### Slow and Steady

One way to tackle is to start early! Many folks with varying degrees of executive disfunction - me included - struggle with getting start when the deadline is so far away. That said, starting as early as you can can provide you opportunity to slowly iterate through ideas. Sometimes it can take a while before you've identified the direction you want to head, so giving yourself time to aimlessly wander, without time pressure, can be a huge help and a lot of fun. As the project as progressed, I try to take this strategy more and more.

- _weeks 1 and 2_ - spend maybe 3 hours each week playing around with ideas and following leads you enjoy.
- _week 3_ - At this point, you may still be in the ideating phase or you may have clear vision of what you want to do. You may be ready to close your cover out, or really just get started with the bulk of it.
- _week 4_ - By this point, you should be casually wrapping things up, obsessively listening to your work with pride and scrutity.

### Back-loaded

In this strategy, don't touch your instrument, DAW, microphone, etc for the first two weeks. Listen to the song a million and a half times to get to a point where you've identified the elements you want to include in your cover, and spend leisure time thinking about the direction you want to take your version. Then, in the last two weeks, go HAM. I think most of my covers have come out of this strategy.

- _weeks 1 and 2_ - Do a lot of song listening, analysis and planning.
- _week 3_ - Jump in! By this point you should have a general idea of the direction you want to take.
- _week 4_ - There's a good change you still have a ton of work to do. Especially if you're newer to music production, or whatever skill you're practicing, don't be surprised if you spend most of your free time this week on closing your song out.

### Procrastination

In this strategy, do nothing until week four. Once week four hits, start screaming, and use the time pressure to mke diamonds.

- _weeks 1 and 2_ - Do a lot of song listening, analysis and planning.
- _week 3_ - Start getting really nervous that you haven't started your cover.
- _week 4_ - AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH. Spend all of your free time working on your cover.

### The one-take recording

In this strategy, you're not doing any fancy production work. Spend as much time as you'd like practicing the song, and when the you're ready, record a one-take cover! Add harmony vocals if you'd like, but you do you!

- _weeks 1 and 2_ - Do a lot of song listening, analysis and planning.
- _week 3_ - Play the song a bunch on your instrument of choice to really get to know it.
- _week 4_ - Record a baller one-take and call it a round!

### Conclusion

Whatever your strategy, have fun with it, and trust your taste! Thank you for participation, and I can't wait to hear what you put together!
