title: How to Get Started
subtitle: My thoughts on getting over the initial hump
---

At this point, we have a little over 5 weeks before the cover is due. That's plenty of time, but time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana.

But where should you begin? I recommend starting early—whatever "starting" means for you (more on that below) to allow yourself time to play and experiment.

I'm writing this to share my thoughts on initiating the process and setting yourself up for a round full of learning and growth.

**Logistical Stuff to Determine**

- If you need to record audio, where and how will you do it? Do you have a place where you can be loud? Have you secured your mic, interface, instruments, DAW, etc?
- Will you have access to all the necessary resources - instruments, recording space, etc? Plan accordingly.

No mic? Cell phone microphones have gotten pretty good!

**Study the Song**
Regardless of your level of familiarity, listen to the song with your fresh "I'm going to cover this" perspective. If you're planning on doing an acoustic cover, pay attention to the chords, rhythms, and melodies. If you're producing your cover, dissect the mix and try to discern the specific decisions the original engineers made. Not sure about your direction? Identify what you find most compelling as you study the song, and follow that inspiration.

**Start**
Begin as early as possible. Sometimes you'll have a clear vision but might be unsure about how to realize it. More often, you'll be uncertain about the direction you want to take—and that's completely okay. No matter your level of certainty, you need to make a start. Play the chords, lay down a bass line—just initiate something.

You are a creative explorer. Before you start, your possibilities are infinite. But once you've played those chords in 4/4, the actions that make sense in that context become far fewer than the infinite options of a blank canvas. If you're unsure about the next step, make a random choice and push ahead. Traverse the unfamiliar with assurance; you can always retrace your steps.

**The Valley of Despair**
Often, a significant chunk of the time dedicated to the cover is spent in what I dub "The Valley of Despair"—that period when you're deep into the cover, it hasn't yet come together, and you're unsure about the final sound.

The fundamental goal of this project is to navigate out of the Valley of Despair. If you find yourself there, don't view it as a negative reflection on your abilities. It's merely a phase in the journey.

**The "A-ha" Moment**
During the process, you might experience moments of clarity. This insight could be specific—like "What if I add a guitar part?" or more abstract, such as envisioning your cover as an allegory of the sky's relationship with the earth, where XYZ symbolizes ABC...

For me, these "A-ha" moments often arise when I'm submerged in the Valley of Despair. Suddenly, a single change can illuminate the remainder of the project. For instance, while working on my `Bad Guy` cover, I was mostly in the Valley. It was only when I decided to drastically tune my chorus vocals on a whim that I had my "A-Ha" moment.

**In Conclusion**
If there's one thing to take away from this is that it's often easier to find direction though action vs. inaction. Starting early gives you an advantage, but be prepared for challenges along the way. As you work on your cover, remember it's a learning process. Have fun with it.
