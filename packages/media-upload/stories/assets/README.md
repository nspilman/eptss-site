# Sample Media Assets

This directory contains sample media files for Storybook stories:

- **sample-image.svg** - 1280x720 gradient image
- **sample-video.js** - Minimal MP4 video data URL

These files are generated programmatically and are used to demonstrate media upload components without external dependencies.
