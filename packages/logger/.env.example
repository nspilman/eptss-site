# Logger Environment Variables

# ============================================
# CLIENT-SIDE POSTHOG (Required for browser tracking)
# ============================================
# Get this from PostHog Dashboard → Project Settings → API Keys
# This is the PUBLIC key that's safe to expose in browser
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phx_your_public_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.posthog.com

# ============================================
# SERVER-SIDE POSTHOG (Optional - Production only)
# ============================================
# This is a DIFFERENT key from NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!
# Get this from PostHog Dashboard → Project Settings → API Keys
# This is a PRIVATE key - only use in server environment
# If not set, server logger will only use Sentry (which is fine)
POSTHOG_SERVER_API_KEY=your_private_server_key_here

# ============================================
# SENTRY (Auto-configured by Next.js)
# ============================================
# Sentry is configured via next.config.js and sentry.*.config.ts
# No additional environment variables needed for the logger
